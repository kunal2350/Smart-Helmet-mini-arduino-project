# Smart-Helmet-mini-arduino-project
A helmet prototype which has ultrasonic sensors, buzzer and LEDs mounted on the helmet and are controlled conditionally by an Arduino Uno.
Bike/bicycle rider might find this helmet very helpful as this helmet will act as their 3rd eye and alarm system while riding. 
The ultrasonic sensors keep checking the distance of vehicles in the vicinity of the rider and if any vehicle comes too close to the rider, the alarm goes off to alert the rider so that he/she can take a propt action. Ultrasonic sensors can work efficiently even at low light environment. Thus this helmet is pretty useful for riding at night on highways.
